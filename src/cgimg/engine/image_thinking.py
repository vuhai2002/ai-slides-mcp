"""Inject an optional `thinking_effort` into the gpt-image-2 prepare payload.

The ChatGPT web UI has an "Intelligence" selector (Instant / Medium / High) that
makes the image model reason more before drawing. More reasoning improves fine
detail and especially TEXT rendering (e.g. Vietnamese diacritics), at the cost of
speed. The vendored backend's image path does NOT send this field (only the
editable PPT/PSD path does), so we add it WITHOUT editing the vendored file:

A class-level wrapper around `OpenAIBackendAPI._prepare_image_conversation`
temporarily intercepts the outgoing image-prepare POST and merges `thinking_effort`
into the picture_v2 payload. Keeping the vendored file byte-identical means
scripts/update-vendor.sh can still re-pull it verbatim. The wrapper depends only
on a stable identifier (the picture_v2 prepare payload shape), not on the method
body, so it survives upstream refactors.

Wire values were reverse-engineered against the live image-prepare endpoint:
the accepted enum is "standard" < "extended" < "max" (anything else -> HTTP 422
"Invalid conversation body"). These correspond to the web UI "Intelligence" menu
(roughly Instant/Medium/High). "auto"/None sends no field -> ChatGPT's default.
